# MaxPapers
Wallpaper web application, created to use what I've learned so far about the Spring Framework.

- The "persistence" module fetches for the requested wallpapers on a MySql database, accessible via SpringJdbc with Apache Commons DBCP for connection pooling.
- Then the "web" module is responsible for generating the web views dynamically with the assistance of Thymeleaf.
- The pages are responsive to a variety of screen sizes.
- The user can search wallpapers by tags, filter by theme and download them.
